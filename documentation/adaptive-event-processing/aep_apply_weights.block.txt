    This block applies the weights calculated by the other AEP blocks to the original stream to produce a single output.

    This block is part of a module for demonstrating Adaptive Event Processing as described in Forsythe, Keith W. "Utilizing waveform features for adaptive beamforming and direction finding with narrowband signals." Lincoln Laboratory Journal 10.2 (1997): 99-126.
