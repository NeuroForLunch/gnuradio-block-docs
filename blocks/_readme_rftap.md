# gr-rftap

## RFtap Module for GNU Radio

This module implements the [RFtap](https://rftap.github.io/) Encapsulation block, used to encapsulate Radio Frequency (RF) metadata about packets for Wireshark. Interoperability was tested with gr-rds, gr-ieee802-11, gr-ieee802-15-4.

You can connect the RFtap Encapsulation block in your flowgraphs to any block that has a PDU Message output port.
