The module is capable of the following:
- Energy detection of continuous signals
- Filtering of detected signals
- OFDM parameter estimation (carrier spacing, symbol time)
- Blind OFDM synchronization
- Resampling of signals to constant rate
- 3D Visualisation of FAM data, from gr-specest (not on GR 3.8 yet)
- Using TensorFlow models for AMC (not on GR 3.8 yet)

## Usage
Get inspired by the examples. There are flowgraphs for each block that should explain how to use them.

For detailed information about each block, visit the Doxygen HTML pages.
## Brief block description

A typical inspector flowgraph could look like this:

#### Signal Detector
Performs an energy detection of continuous input signals. A threshold in dB can be set or an autmatic threshold calculation can be used.

#### Inspector GUI
GUI where the spectrum is displayed along with signal markers for the detected signals. Also, signal can be selected manually in this block.

#### Signal Separator
Takes the signal info from the previous blocks and performs a down-mixing, filtering and decimation of each detected signal. The samples for each signal are passed on as a message.

#### Signal Extractor
Adapter block to extract the samples of one signal out of the messages from the Signal Separator. Output is again a complex stream.

Resampling can be used to assure a constant output sample rate of the stream. (Needed for FM demod for instance.)

#### OFDM Estimator
Estimates the parameters subcarrier spacing, symbol time, FFT size and cyclic prefix length for a input signal. The signal should not be oversampled for this block.

#### OFDM Synchronizer
After OFDM parameter estimation, the signal is frequency synced and symbol beginnings are marked with stream tags.

The target is to develop a signal analysis / signal intelligence toolbox with the following capabilities:

- Automatic signal detection
- Automatic modulation classification
- OFDM parameter estimation and synchronization
- GUI feedback
- Doxygen documentation

The modulation classification is developed by @chrisruk during ESA Summer of Code in Space program.
